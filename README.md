### EcologicalNetworksPlots

This package provides plotting abilities for `EcologicalNetworks.jl`. It uses
`Plots.jl` and `RecipesBase.jl` to do the plotting. The package currently
generates force-directed layouts, with planned support for circular layouts.

It is currently not registered, and works with *Julia* `0.7` and `1.0` **only**.
